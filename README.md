# Cascade-Model-Rainfall-Disaggregation
Disaggregate rainfall time series using a multiplicative discrete random cascade model
Parameters of the model are identified using the maximum likelihood method
The model is evaluated using the fitted parameters and rainfall is simulated
The output of one level is the input to the second level
The script CascadeModel.py finds the model parameters and runs the simulations
The script HistogramWeights is used to plot the results
Work is still in progress for developping the model.
In case the model is used please be kind to reference is :)
